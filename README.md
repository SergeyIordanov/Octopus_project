## The Idea
The idea is to create the platform where people can compete with each other by creating and accepting challenges.
The main tool is camera.

## How It Works?
 1) The User creates a challenge and the others meet it by publishing their photos.  
 2) The community chooses the best picture.  
 3) The creator gets beautiful photos and detailed statistics. The best photo owner achieves some price.
